# Unique-Password-Generator
A password Generator that creates unique passwords for the user.
My motivation for this project was the hope to test what I know in Javascript and create a functional project that I am proud of.
I built the javascript in the file because it would really test my skills and what I learned, same as my motivation.
The problem it solves is creating a safe, secure password for someone that needs one.
I learned that I need more practice in the field of Javascript and actually applying the lessons to real life projects and that I may understand a concept but it does not mean I can apply it to a page just yet.
My project doesn't necessarily stand out in a good way, but it shows that I am really trying my best and that's all I can do for myself.
